## Summary
In this project, we have access to approximately 50 datasets. Each one contains reviews of a specific product, from clothing apparel to wireless products. I chose home improvement revidws and used PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the reviews, transform the data about the reviews, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, I used PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset. Then, I wrote a summary of the analysis for Jennifer to submit to the SellBy stakeholders.
